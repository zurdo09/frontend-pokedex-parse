# Learning AngularJS with Github
In this project you must use Github's public timeline to build a table of all events.
The data is in JSON format in the data folder, with the name [2015-01-01-15.json](data/2015-01-01-15.json).


## Prepare project
To get up and running, you must:
1. Fork the project
2. clone it locally
3. install npm modules
```{shell}
sudo npm install
```
4. install bower components
```{shell}
sudo bower install
```


## User Stories
- As a user I must be able to view all the Github events in an organized fashion (use table)

- As a user I must be able to filter the information in the table by event type,
